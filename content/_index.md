桃花源记——陶渊明

晋太元中，武陵人捕鱼为业，缘溪行，忘路之远近。忽逢桃花林，夹岸数百步，中无杂树，芳草鲜美，落英缤纷；
渔人甚异之。复前行，欲穷其林。林尽水源，便得一山。山有小口，仿佛若有光，便舍船，从口入。初极狭，才通人；
复行数十步，豁然开朗。土地平旷，屋舍俨然。有良田美池，桑竹之属，阡陌交通，鸡犬相闻。其中往来种作，男女衣着，悉如外人；
黄发垂髫，并怡然自乐。见渔人，乃大惊，问所从来；具答之。便要还家，设酒、杀鸡、作食。村中闻有此人，咸来问讯。
自云：先世避秦时乱，率妻子邑人来此绝境，不复出焉；遂与外人间隔。问今是何世？乃不知有汉，无论魏、晋！
此人一一为具言所闻，皆叹惋。余人各复延至其家，皆出酒食，停数日，辞去。此中人语云：“不足为外人道。”

既出，得其船，便扶向路，处处志之。及郡下，诣太守，说如此。太守即遣人随其往，寻向所志，遂迷不复得路。
南阳刘子骥，高尚士也，闻之，欣然规往，未果，寻病终。后遂无问津者。

The Peach Colony (translated by Lin Yutang 林语堂)

During the reign of Taiyuan of Chin, there was a fisherman of Wuling.
One day he was walking along a bank. After having gone a certain distance, he suddenly came upon a peach grove which
extended along the bank for about a hundred yards. He noticed with surprise that the grove had a magic effect,
so singularly free from the usual mingling of brushwood, while the beautifully grassy ground was covered with its
rose petals. He went further to explore, and when he came to the end of the grove, he saw a spring which came from a
cave in the hill, Having noticed that there seemed to be a weak light in the cave, he tied up his boat and decided to
go in and explore. At first the opening was very narrow, barely wide enough for one person to go in. After a dozen
steps, it opened into a flood of light. He saw before his eyes a wide, level valley, with houses and fields and farms.
There were bamboos and mulberries; farmers were working and dogs and chickens were running about. The dresses of the
men and women were like those of the outside world, and the old men and children appeared very happy and contented.
They were greatly astonished to see the fisherman and asked him where he had come from. The fisherman told them and
was invited to their homes, where wine was served and chicken was killed for dinner to entertain him. The villagers
hearing of his coming all came to see him and to talk. They said that their ancestors had come here as refugees to
escape from the tyranny of Tsin Shih-huang (builder of Great Wall) some six hundred years ago, and they had never
left it. They were thus completely cut off from the world, and asked what was the ruling dynasty now. They had not
even heard of the Han Dynasty (two centuries before to two centuries after Christ), not to speak of the Wei
(third century A.D.) and the Chin (third and fourth centuries). The fisherman told them, which they heard with
great amazement. Many of the other villagers then began to invite him to their homes by turn and feed him dinner
and wine.After a few days, he took leave of them and left. The villagers begged him not to tell the people
outside about their colony.

The man found his boat and came back, marking with signs the route he had followed. He went to the magistrate’s
office and told the magistrate about it. The latter sent someone to go with him and find the place. They looked
for the signs but got lost and could never find it again. Liu Tsechi of Nanyang was a great idealist. He heard
of this story, and planned to go and find it, but was taken ill and died before he could fulfill his wish.
Since then, no one has gone in search of this place.
